    <h1>Basics to Web Dev</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>What is WEB DEVELOPMENT?</h3>

    <p>Web development is the process of creating, maintaining, and building websites.
        <br>
        Web development primarily consists of:
        <ul>
        <li>Front-End Development</li>
        <li>Back-End Development</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>What Frontend and Backend?</h3>

    <p>Front-End Development involves
        the visual and interactive aspects
        of websites using HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>Back-End Development focuses on
        server-side operations, databases,
        and server logic using languages like
        Python, Javascript, etc.
    </p>

    <h3>What is a website?</h3>

    <p>A website is a set of web pages you can visit on the internet.</p>

    <h3>How does a website work?</h3>

    <p>In the request-response cycle, a
        client asks a server for data or
        services, and the server sends back
        the requested information. This
        process allows users to access
        content on the internet.
        In case of websites, the response is
        an HTML document.
    </p>

    <h3>What makes up a website?</h3>

    <p>
        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
        defines the structure of a webpage, like the
        skeleton.
    </p>

    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) defines the
        design or style of the webpage, like skin and
        clothes.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        JS (JavaScript) defines the behavior of the
        webpage, like making the skeleton move.
